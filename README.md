# PPTA data sets for PSR J0437-4715

A collection of times of arrival (ToAs), pulsar ephemerides, and noise models from multiple Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) data sets for the nearest and brightest millisecond pulsar, PSR 
J0437-4715.
 
The data in this repository are described and used in Reardon et al. (2024), "The neutron star mass, distance, and inclination from precision timing of the brilliant millisecond pulsar J0437-4715" - 
a timing and noise analysis conducted for the primary purpose of supporting NASA's Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) mission by providing a precise pulsar mass measurement.
